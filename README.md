## Introduction:
Hippocorpus is a dataset which is used to examine the cognitive processes of remembering and imagining and their traces in language. a dataset of 6,854 English diary-like short stories about recalled and imagined events. This data is collected from the recalled stories and summaries from workers and then provide these summaries to writers who write imaginary stories using crowdsourcing framework. Finally, months later, we collect a retold version of the recalled stories from a subset of recalled authors. The dataset comes with author demographics (age, gender, race), their openness to experience, as well as some variables regarding the author's relationship to the event.
## Potential Applications and Values:
It is used to study human memory and cognitive process which helps to mimic the human brain.

## Why it is Interesting?
The book discusses all aspects of big data. It explains many interesting concepts in a well-crafted manner with examples. We can get to know about how to make sense of big data (data correlation, bias free interpretation, visualization as a sense making tool, strategic decision making), business and social implications of big data, how big data is used in health care, and how should big data abuses be addressed.
